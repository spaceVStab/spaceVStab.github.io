#### Snapshots

Snapshots files are produced by the softwares which can be taken input by data-analysis software like (Paraview)[http://www.paraview.org/]. Snapshots are stored in the Device memory by default and transferred back to Host memory at the end of the simulation. In case of OpenCl, checks are performed to make sure the Device memory is greater than the memory required by software with snapshots. If that is not the case, the values are transferred back to Host at every instance. Due to this, the communication overhead leads to excessive solving time. 

`OpenClSolver` supports snapshots in a usual fashion as does the standard solver. The `snapshots.cl` kernel file is used to build the Program from which the Kernel functions are called. 

#### MPI

gprMax can also support task-farming MPI with no-spawn with OpenCl Solver in a usual fashion as a user would run MPI with standard Solver. 

In addition to features of Snaphots and MPI, further memory checks to avoid failures in executions are added. 

For this work on snapshots and MPI, [#220](https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax/pull/220) is the merged PR.
