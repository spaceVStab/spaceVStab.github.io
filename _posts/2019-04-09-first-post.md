## Hello There !!

I will maintain this personal website with my ideas, projects I am working on and some strange stories :p

Recently, I have added a proposal for Google Summer of Code to contribute to [**grpMax**](http://www.gprmax.com/). gprMax is an open source software for electromagnetic simulation especially designed for parallelizing operations using OpenMP, MPI or CUDA Kernels. I have proposed to add the feature for running the simulations based on OpenCl accelerators. Find my proposal [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lG_GW5REkjMihrtbBonxCqwEs7THf4ts)

[Update] My proposal is accepted :D
